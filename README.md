```
 Solution:
	1. Update Kernel    
	2. Create audio group: sudo groupadd audio
	3. Add your user to audio group: sudo gpasswd -a <username> audio
	4. Create group limits file for audio group: sudo nano /etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf
	5. Add the following lines to audio.conf:
  
 		@audio   -  rtprio     95
		@audio   -  memlock    unlimited
		#@audio   -  nice       -19
 
	6. Reboot
```

### Playing Youtube audio with Hifiberry and Raspberry Pi
Run the mpv media player software from the terminal with the Youtube link as the first parameter and the --no-video option in case a monitor is not available:

> mpv https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9bk2MrMGaA --no-video

## UI/UX elements needed

### Starting screen

- high-quality close-up image of a guitar at the top of the screen
- short appealing description
- start button
- logo at the bottom of the screen

### Pedal switch screen (first screen)

This screen should allow the user to switch between different pedals by swiping left and/or right, turn them on/off and adjust sound settings. By sliding downwards, the user is led to the second screen.

- Wooden background
- An image of a pedal positioned in the center of the screen + input/output Jack wires 
- The logo is positioned in the upper left corner of the screen

### Pedal pipelines screen (second screen)
The second screen allows the user to build a pipeline i.e. a sequence of pedals, each taking as input either the guitar signal directly or the output of other pedals.

- Wooden background
- Jack ports positioned in the center of each side of the screen 
- At the bottom of the screen, an up-arrow is placed which, if pressed, triggers a pop-up containing multiple options of pedals. The list of pedals can be scrolled horizontally. 
- To place a pedal on the floor, drag it from the pop-up outwards
- To connect pedals to one another, drag cables from the previously-mentioned pop-up

### Project diagram

This diagram is a mixture of a structural and behavioral UML diagram. Since the Jetpack Compose toolkit works based on functions/so-called "composables" rather than classes, a UML class diagram wouldn't make much sense, but aggregation/composition relationships are still used nonetheless. The double-arrowed relationship represents a swipe action prompted by the user.
